Moreover, dental clinics are expected to remain a significant channel for the distribution of cold light whitening devices, as patients often trust professionals for cosmetic dental procedures.</p><p><strong>Beauty Institutions:</strong> Beauty institutions are becoming an increasingly popular venue for cold light tooth whitening treatments. These establishments cater to individuals seeking aesthetic improvements, including teeth whitening, as part of their overall beauty regime.
